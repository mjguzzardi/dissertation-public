This is a repository to supplement the MSc dissertation: "Convenience, technology, and urban mobility: quantifying the effect of user-friendly public bike system improvements on Citi Bike ridership"

All code is in R and will either be in a .Rmd file format (R Markdown) or in a .R file format if it is a smaller script.
